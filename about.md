Hello world. My name is Don Teo. I am a research engineer
at [Thomson Reuters](http://thomsonreuters.com) working on
applications of machine learning and natural language
processing. Previously, I was an implementation engineer
at [Opower](https://opower.com) and, before that, a graduate research
student at
the
[Laboratory for Elementary Particle Physics](http://www.classe.cornell.edu/) at
Cornell University. My PhD research topic was the search for new
fundamental particles with the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the
Large Hadron Collider.
