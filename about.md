Hello world. My name is Don Teo. I am a computational scientist at
[Enel X](https://www.enelx.com). Previously, I was a research
scientist at [Thomson Reuters](http://thomsonreuters.com) working on
applications of machine learning and natural language
processing. Before that, I was an implementation engineer at
[Opower](https://opower.com).  During my graduate studies, I was a part of the
[Laboratory for Elementary Particle
Physics](http://www.classe.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. My PhD
research topic was the search for new fundamental particles with the
Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.

This blog is yet another collection of musings in machine learning.
