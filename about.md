Hello world. My name is Don Teo. I am an implementation engineer at
[Opower](https://opower.com).  Previously, I was a graduate research
student at the Laboratory for Elementary Particle Physics at Cornell
University. My PhD research topic was the search for new fundamental
particles with the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large
Hadron Collider.
